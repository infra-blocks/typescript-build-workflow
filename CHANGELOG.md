## [1.1.0] - 2024-04-19

### Added

- The skip intput to skip on the callee's side of a `worfklow_call`. Otherwise, when the workflow is skipped from
  the caller's side (with an `if` expression), the check path when the workflow was run is not the same as when
  it was skipped ( `outer / inner` vs. `outer` when skipped) !
